## 🧠 Business Problem

Customer reviews contain valuable insights about satisfaction drivers and pain points, but the volume and unstructured nature of text makes manual analysis slow and inconsistent. 

---

## 🎯 Objective 

The objective of this project was to build an NLP pipeline that automatically analyzes hotel reviews to identify sentiment and extract key themes that can guide service and product improvements.

---

## 📊 Data & Inputs

- Unstructured hotel review text (customer feedback)
- Optional structured fields (ratings, metadata) if available
- Text transformed into numerical representations using TF-IDF and/or embeddings

---

## ⚙️ Technical Approach

- Built an end-to-end text preprocessing pipeline including tokenization, stopword removal, normalization, and lemmatization to prepare raw text for modeling
- Extracted features using TF-IDF and/or embedding-based representations, and trained supervised models for sentiment classification
- Evaluated and iterated on model performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score
- Conducted text analytics to surface frequent themes/keywords and translate findings into actionable customer insight patterns

---

## 🛠 Key Skills Demonstrated

- NLP preprocessing and feature engineering
- Text classification and model evaluation
-	Working with unstructured data and extracting themes
- Turning ML outputs into business insights
- End-to-end ML workflow (data → model → insights)
