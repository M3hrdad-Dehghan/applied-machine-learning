## 🧠 Business Problem

Accurately estimating car market prices is essential for buyers and sellers to make informed decisions and avoid under- or over-pricing in a competitive market. 

---

## 🎯 Objective 

The objective of this project was to build a robust regression-based machine learning system that predicts car prices based on vehicle attributes and historical market data.

---

## 📊 Data & Inputs

- Historical car listings including price, model, brand, year, mileage, fuel type, and other vehicle attributes
- Structured tabular data used for supervised learning
- User-provided inputs collected through an interactive application interface

---

## ⚙️ Technical Approach

- Performed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and feature engineering to prepare high-quality inputs for modeling
- Built and tuned multiple regression models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) and compared performance using appropriate evaluation metrics
- Designed a reliable preprocessing and inference pipeline to ensure consistency between training and production
- Deployed the trained model as an interactive application, enabling real-time price predictions

## 🛠 Key Skills Demonstrated

- Regression modeling and supervised machine learning
- Feature engineering and model evaluation
- End-to-end ML pipelines (training to inference)
-	Model deployment and user-facing ML applications
- Translating predictive models into real-world decision tools
