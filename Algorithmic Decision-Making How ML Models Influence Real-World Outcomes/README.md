## 🧠 Business Problem

In many real-world systems—such as credit approval, risk assessment, hiring, or eligibility screening—machine learning models directly influence critical decisions that affect people’s lives. 

---

## 🎯 Objective 

The objective of this project was to analyze how ML/AI decision models operate in high-stakes contexts, understand how prediction scores are translated into decisions, and evaluate the implications of thresholds, bias, and model behavior on final outcomes.

---

## 📊 Data & Inputs

- Structured tabular datasets representing individual profiles (features used for prediction and decision-making)
- Target variables representing approval, rejection, or risk outcomes
- Model-generated prediction scores and probability outputs
- Decision thresholds used to convert predictions into final actions

---

## ⚙️ Technical Approach

- Built and analyzed machine learning classification models to simulate real-world decision systems where predictions directly determine outcomes
- Examined the full decision pipeline, including feature contribution, probability calibration, and threshold selection
- Conducted model interpretability analysis to understand how different features influence predictions and decisions
- Evaluated model behavior across different decision boundaries to observe how small changes in inputs or thresholds alter outcomes
- Investigated risks related to bias, fairness, and unequal impact, focusing on how automated decisions may disproportionately affect certain groups

---

## 🛠 Key Skills Demonstrated

- Machine learning for decision systems (classification)
- Model interpretability and decision boundary analysis
- Threshold tuning and probability-based decision logic
- Responsible AI thinking (bias, fairness, impact awareness)
- Translating model behavior into human-understandable insights
