## 🧠 Business Problem & Objective

In subscription-based digital platforms like **Apple Music**, customer retention is a critical driver of long-term revenue.  
While many users subscribe at least once, only a small portion return to renew their subscription.

Unfocused marketing campaigns targeting low-probability users lead to wasted advertising spend and inefficient resource allocation.

---

## 🎯 Objective 

Build a predictive machine learning model to estimate the likelihood of a customer renewing their subscription and enable targeted retention strategies.

---

## 📊 Data & Inputs

🎧 User listening behavior (total & average listening minutes) </br>
💳 Purchase features (total & average spending) </br>
⭐ Engagement signals (ratings, reviews, support tickets) </br>
⏱ Customer lifetime (days since first usage) </br>
🎯 Binary target variable indicating subscription renewal

---

## ⚙️ Technical Approach

⭕ Framed the problem as a supervised **binary classification** task </br>
⭕ Data preprocessing with **NumPy** (feature selection, shuffling, label separation) </br>
⭕ Train / validation / test split for robust evaluation </br>
⭕ Feature scaling applied only on training data to prevent data leakage </br>
⭕ Designed a **deep neural network** using TensorFlow: Multiple dense layers / Activation functions / Dropout and L2 regularization </br>
⭕ Handled class imbalance using computed class weights </br>
⭕ Trained with **Adam optimizer** and binary cross-entropy loss </br>
⭕ Early stopping based on validation loss to prevent overfitting </br>
⭕ Final evaluation on unseen test data
