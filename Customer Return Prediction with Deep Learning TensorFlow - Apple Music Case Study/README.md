## 🧠 Business Problem & Objective

In subscription-based digital platforms like **Apple Music**, customer retention is a critical driver of long-term revenue.  
While many users subscribe at least once, only a small portion return to renew their subscription.

Unfocused marketing campaigns targeting low-probability users lead to wasted advertising spend and inefficient resource allocation.

🎯 **Objective:**  
Build a predictive machine learning model to estimate the likelihood of a customer renewing their subscription and enable targeted retention strategies.

## 📊 Data & Inputs

- 🎧 User listening behavior (total & average listening minutes)
- 💳 Purchase features (total & average spending)
- ⭐ Engagement signals (ratings, reviews, support tickets)
- ⏱ Customer lifetime (days since first usage)
- 🎯 Binary target variable indicating subscription renewal

## ⚙️ Technical Approach

- 🧩 Framed the problem as a supervised **binary classification** task
- 🧹 Data preprocessing with **NumPy** (feature selection, shuffling, label separation)
- 🔀 Train / validation / test split for robust evaluation
- 📐 Feature scaling applied only on training data to prevent data leakage
- 🧠 Designed a **deep neural network** using TensorFlow:
  - Multiple dense layers
  - Activation functions
  - Dropout and L2 regularization
- ⚖️ Handled class imbalance using computed class weights
- 🚀 Trained with **Adam optimizer** and binary cross-entropy loss
- ⏹ Early stopping based on validation loss to prevent overfitting
- 🧪 Final evaluation on unseen test data
