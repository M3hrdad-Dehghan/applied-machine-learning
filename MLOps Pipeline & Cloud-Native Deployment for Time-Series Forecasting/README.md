## 🧠 Business Problem & Objective

Accurately forecasting taxi demand is critical for optimizing fleet allocation, reducing wait times, and improving operational efficiency in urban transportation systems. 

---

## 🎯 Objective 

The objective of this project was to build a scalable, data-driven forecasting solution that predicts future taxi demand and supports real-time decision-making through automated ML pipelines.

---

## 📊 Data & Inputs

- Historical taxi trip records aggregated by time and location
- Temporal features (hour, day of week, seasonality patterns)
- External signals and derived features for time-series modeling
- Data stored and processed using BigQuery and Python-based pipelines

---

## ⚙️ Technical Approach

- Implemented end-to-end time-series forecasting models using BigQuery ML and Python, covering data aggregation, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation
- Designed a cloud-native MLOps pipeline to automate preprocessing, training, and inference with reproducible workflows
- Deployed a containerized, low-latency forecasting API on Cloud Run, enabling scalable and production-grade demand predictions

---

## 🛠 Key Skills Demonstrated

- Time-series forecasting and feature engineering
- BigQuery ML and large-scale data processing
- MLOps pipelines and reproducible ML workflows
- Cloud-native deployment (GCP, Cloud Run, Docker)
- API-based ML inference and production ML systems
